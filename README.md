# liri-node-app
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

###What you need to know...
LIRI uses BandsInTown, Spotify, and OMDB API to get information back to you, the user. Presents your query in a simple format , easy to understand. LIRI is especially useful in cases when you **don't** want to go to multiple different sites to get simple information. Now that we got that out of the way, are you ready to start using LIRI?!
