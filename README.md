# liri-node-app

> LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI uses BandsInTown, Spotify, and OMDB API to get information back to you, the user. Presents your query in a simple format , easy to understand. LIRI is especially useful in cases when you **don't** want to go to multiple different sites to get simple information. Now that we got that out of the way, are you ready to start using LIRI?!
